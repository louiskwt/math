# Competing The Square

[Completing the Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completing_the_square) is a technique for converting a quadratic polynomial of the form $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ to the form $`a(x-h)^2+k`$

## Steps and Examples for monic quadratic

Let's say we have a quadratic equation of $`x^2 + 6x + 11`$

1. divide b, which is 6, by 2 and add that after bx, and we get:

   $` x^2 + 6x + (\dfrac{6}{2})^2 + 11 `$

2. to balance things out, we need to subtract $`(\dfrac{b}{2})^2`$

   $` x^2 + 6x + (3)^2 - (3)^2 + 11 `$

3. Using the difference of square, we can simplify to get:

   $` (x + 3)^2 - 9 + 11 `$

4. Lastly, we takes care of like terms and get this:

   $` (x + 3)^2 + 2 `$
