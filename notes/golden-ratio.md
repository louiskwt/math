# Golden Ratio

In Mathematics, when two quantities like a and b (where both a and b are greater than 0) has a ratio that is equal to the ratio of the sum of the 2 quantities and the larger quantity of the two, then it's known to have a golden ratio of arrpoximately 1 : 1.6.

## Representation in mathematical notion

$`\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{a + b}{a} = \phi`$

## 3 Equations from the definiton and some interesting manipulations

1. $`\dfrac{a}{b} = \phi`$

2. $`\dfrac{a + b}{a} = \phi`$

3. $`\dfrac{a}{a} + \dfrac{b}{a} = \phi`$

   $`1 + \dfrac{1}{\phi} = \phi`$

## Deriving the value of golden ratio

1. Take equation 3 from above.

2. Rearragne the whole equation into this

   $`\phi - 1 = \dfrac{1}{\phi}`$

3. Multiply both side with $`\phi`$

   $`\phi^2 - \phi = 1`$

4. Subtract 1 from both side

   $`\phi^2 - \phi - 1 = 0`$

5. Solve the for $`\phi`$ using quadratic equation

   $`\phi = \dfrac{-(-1)\pm\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}`$

   $`\phi = \dfrac{1\pm\sqrt{1 + 4}}{2(1)}`$

   $`\phi = \dfrac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2(1)}`$

6. Since both a and b has to be greater than zero, so the value of golden ratio will be:

   $`\dfrac{1+\sqrt(5)}{2}`$ or $`\approx 1.61803399`$
