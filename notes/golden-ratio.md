# Golden Ratio

In Mathematics, when two quantities like a and b (where both a and b are greater than 0) has a ratio that is equal to the ratio of the sum of the 2 quantities and the larger quantity of the two, then it's known to have a golden ratio of arrpoximately 1 : 1.6.

## Representation in mathematical notion

$`\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{a + b}{a} = \phi`$

## 3 Equations from the definiton and some interesting manipulations

1. $`\dfrac{a}{b} = \phi`$

2. $`\dfrac{a + b}{a} = \phi`$

3. $`\dfrac{a}{a} + \dfrac{b}{a} = \phi`$
   $`1 + \drfac{1}{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \phi`$
   $`1 + \dfrac{1}{\phi} = \phi`$
